It incorporates a routing head that decides when (and how) to invoke a tool versus answering directly, reducing hallucinated calls.

Built on top of DeepSeek-R1’s reasoning foundation, it integrates 110k examples from the Tulu-3 SFT dataset and 350k internally curated multilingual safety-alignment samples. The model retains strong reasoning, coding, and problem-solving capabilities, while unblocking a wide range of prompts previously restricted in R1.\n\nMAI-DS-R1 demonstrates improved performance on harm mitigation benchmarks and maintains competitive results across general reasoning tasks. It surpasses R1-1776 in satisfaction metrics for blocked queries and reduces leakage in harmful content categories. The model is based on a transformer MoE architecture and is suitable for general-purpose use cases, excluding high-stakes domains such as legal, medical, or autonomous systems."

The model features three adjustable reasoning effort levels and supports key developer capabilities including function calling, structured outputs, and streaming, though it does not include vision processing capabilities.\n\nThe model demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor, with expert testers preferring its responses 56% of the time and noting a 39% reduction in major errors on complex questions. With medium reasoning effort settings, o3-mini matches the performance of the larger o1 model on challenging reasoning evaluations like AIME and GPQA, while maintaining lower latency and cost."

Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.\n- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs. Reasoning tokens are priced at $3/1M tokens"

It supports a 128K token context length and integrates smoothly with inference frameworks like vLLM and SGLang. While it inherits safety characteristics from its base model, no additional alignment was applied.
